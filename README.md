# [Citation Needed](https://childishgiant.github.io/citation-needed)

### What?
This is a dumb little project where I can dump all the wikipedia articles I stumble upon that I find interesting. A full list see of pages include, see [pages.md](pages.md) or if you want to get technical look at the [JSON](src/data.json).

These are both updated by a [script](esbuild/reader.js) that reads the latest export of my bookmarks and converts the data into a form that the site can read.
